# geegler
Mini PHP Framework

Installation by composer
1. Create a composer.json file as shown below. TBS or tinyButStrong and Twig template engines are included.
   Geegler utilizes either TBS or TWIG template engine. Smarty template engine can also be use.



       {
       		"minimum-stability": "dev",
                     	"require":{
                               	"geegler/geegler": "dev-master",
                               	"tinybutstrong/tinybutstrong": "dev-master"
 		                 },
               		 "repositories": [
                                  	{
                                   	 "type": "vcs",
                                   	 "url": "https://github.com/geegler/geegler"
                                 	 }
                               		],
			"autoload":{
					"files":[ "app/configs/appconstants.php"
                                
                            		]
							
				
				
				
				}
								

	}
    
    
    
2. Move the intaller.php from vendor/geegler/geegler/ directory to your application directory. Use your browswer to execute the installer. e.g. http://localhost/yourapp/installer.php. After the initial files are created, type this on the composer command line

	composer dump-autoload -o
	
3. Now your simple app is ready to view at http://localhost/yourapp/ or http://localhost/yourapp/main/.

4. You can create your own controller and model similar to the example applications generated by the installer.php.
